# About Project
I have prepared a reference C# Test Project setup with Code Coverage.
The Project is .NET5.0 (unfortunately needs to be) but your project can still have .NET Framework. No issue on that.
The project is setup for xUnit and Coverlet.
I have prepared a shell script along with it which will handle the code coverage and report generation.
