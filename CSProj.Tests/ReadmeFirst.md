# CSProj.Tests

This is the Unit Test project for CSProj.
xUnit Testing Framework has been employed along with Coverlet for Code coverage.

## IMP: About Test Coverage Report generation

Run GenerateTestCoverageReport.ps1 using Powershell.
If using CMD, then run "powershell GenerateTestCoverageReport.ps1"
A TestCoverageReport.html file will be created in the TestCoverageReport folder which nothing but a shortcut of index.html generated by the tool.

NOTE:
- No need to change root directory as the script itself wll do so for itself.
- You can ignore the warning during builds and the errors for files after Unit tests are ran.
- The core index.html resides in TestCoverageReport\Coverage folder.

## About Build

Errors might be shown in files of Test Project when building from clean. You can ignore those and start the build.
- The reason is that the project relies on the output dll created by the CSProj project.
- This file will naturally be missing in clean environment thus the Errors.
- Due to build dependencies the dll will get created first and then this project will build so nothing to worry about.

When the project is Cleaned, the Proj has been setup to wipe the TestCoverageReport folder as well.

Also since Test are never meant to be shipped the Solution has been set to exclude this project when building Release flavor.
